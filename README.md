## 📖 Description
A disaster is a serious disruption in the functioning of a community or a society,
which exceeds the ability of the affected community to cope using its own resources.  
Disasters cause widespread human, economic, environmental, and material impacts — such as cyclones, floods, earthquakes, and pandemics.  

**Disaster Management** refers to the conservation of lives and property during natural and man-made disasters.  
This project is built with the aim to **reduce damage, improve preparedness, and help people in crisis situations.**

The project includes three main phases aligned with disaster stages, designed to provide quick response and efficient coordination.
